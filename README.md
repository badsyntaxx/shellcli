### A powershell scripts library

# Shell CLI

This is my PowerShell script library for various Windows tasks. No need to download anything; just enter a command and gain access. Shell CLI is
particularly useful for IT professionals who need to perform tasks on the backend without disrupting the user. It can handle tasks such as modifying
user data (including groups and passwords), making changes to the network adapter, and more.

## Before we begin

NOTE There are some anti-virus softwares that block Shell CLI. Some do and some don't. If you encounter an av software that does there are some
[steps you can take](https://github.com/badsyntaxx/shellcli?tab=readme-ov-file#bypass-anti-virus).

You may also need to enable running powershell scripts on your system.

## Getting started

Open powershell as an administrator, paste in the command below and hit Enter. Thats it!

Getting started\
`irm shellcli.com | iex`

The above command is shorthand Powershell. It is the same as\
`Invoke-RestMethod shellcli.com | Invoke-Expression`

## Using the menu

If you don't know any commands, you can just enter the `menu` command. Once in the menu, you can use the _up_ and _down_ arrow keys to make selections
and then the enter key to confirm your selection.\

## Using commands

You don't need to rely on the menu. You can accomplish more, faster, by accessing commands directly. For instance, creating a new user or editing the
target PC's network adapter can be done with short intuitive commands.

Add a new local user to the system.\
`add local user`

Edit the network adapters on target PC.\
`edit net adapter`

## Enable running powershell

Its fairly common that running powershell scripts is disabled by default. You can enable running powershell scripts by opening powershell as an
administrator and entering this command.

Set the execution policy to unrestricted. `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

## Bypass anti-virus

Some anti-virus programs will block the use of Shell CLI. Most of the time the inital connection command is what triggers the anti-virus. Thats
because of the irm (Invoke-RestMethod) portion of the command. The reason anti-virus softwares will sometimes block this command is because it can be
used to send and retrieve information over the internet. In this case you retrieve the root powershell functions of Shell CLI.

To bypass this problem you can download and run or paste in the root functions of Shell CLI.
